# Get Up

A Rust CLI that delivers a daily motivational briefing with **LeetCode** and **Deep-ML** problems, on-this-day history with your age, running stats, and an inspirational quote. Posts to **GitHub Issues**, **Telegram DM**, and **Discord DM**.

## Features

- **Multi-platform problems** — LeetCode (Easy/Medium/Hard) + Deep-ML (Easy/Medium/Hard) with scheduled difficulty
- **Difficulty scheduling** — Weekdays: one problem per platform per day (a weekly rotation of 3 Easy + 2 Medium), Weekends: Medium + Hard per platform
- **Time-aware greeting** — `Good morning` / `Good afternoon` / `Good evening` based on your local hour
- **Your age in history** — Wikipedia on-this-day events tagged with how old you were
- **Running stats** — reads parquet or CSV from Strava / OpenTracks / any app that exports run data
- **Triple notification** — GitHub Issue comment + Telegram DM + Discord DM
- **Morning & night routines** — `--night` for an evening summary variant
- **MCP server** — Model Context Protocol integration with stdio and HTTP transports for AI agent workflows
- **Structured output** — `--json` or `--xml` for machine-readable results
- **GitHub Actions cron** — fires daily via CI, zero-maintenance

| `mcp` | Start the MCP server (`--transport stdio\|http`, `--port 3000`) |

## Agent Experience (AX)

Get Up is built for AI agents as much as humans. Every component returns structured data, the routine engine is idempotent, and the MCP server gives agents direct access to each section independently.

### How Agents Connect

Two transport modes via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/):

```bash
# stdio — for local agents (Cursor, Claude Code, opencode, etc.)
cargo run --release --features mcp -- mcp

# HTTP — for remote agents or multi-client setups
cargo run --release --features mcp -- mcp --transport http --port 3000
```

In your agent's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "get-up": {
      "command": "cargo",
      "args": ["run", "--release", "--features", "mcp", "--", "mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/get-up/rust-routine-daily"
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP transport, point your agent at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

### Available Tools

The server exposes six tools. Each returns JSON by default.

| Tool | Parameters | Returns |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `run_routine` | `routine_type`, `include_*` toggles, `format` | Full `RoutineResult` with all requested sections |
| `get_problems` | — | List of problems from LeetCode and Deep-ML with platform, difficulty, URL, daily challenge flag |
| `get_quote` | — | Quote text, author, source |
| `get_history` | — | List of events with year, text, Wikipedia URL, age context |
| `get_running_stats` | — | Yesterday / month / year distances and session counts |
| `get_year_progress` | — | Day of year, total days, percentage, visual bar |

### `run_routine` Parameters

The main tool gives agents full control over what they receive:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `routine_type` | `"morning"` / `"night"` | `"morning"` | Which routine variant to run |
| `include_problems` | bool | `true` | Include daily problems (LeetCode + Deep-ML) |
| `include_running` | bool | `true` | Include running stats |
| `include_history` | bool | `true` | Include on-this-day events |
| `include_quote` | bool | `true` | Include motivational quote |
| `include_year_progress` | bool | `true` | Include year progress bar |
| `format` | `"json"` / `"xml"` / `"text"` | `"json"` | Output format |

Example: get only problems and quote in JSON:

```json
{
  "include_problems": true,
  "include_running": false,
  "include_history": false,
  "include_quote": true,
  "include_year_progress": false,
  "format": "json"
}
```

### Example Agent Workflows

**Morning briefing agent** — call `run_routine` with defaults, summarize the result in natural language, and remind the user of their problems.

**Running coach agent** — call `get_running_stats` to check recent mileage, then suggest today's distance based on weekly trends.

**History curator agent** — call `get_history` to get today's events, pick the most interesting one, and write a short story about it.

**Progress tracker agent** — call `get_year_progress` to check how far into the year we are, then compare against goals.

### Design for Agents

- **Idempotent** — calling any tool multiple times with the same config returns the same result. No side effects like posting or marking problems as used.
- **Composable** — each section is independent. Agents can mix and match what they need.
- **Structured** — all tools return JSON with consistent field names. No parsing prose required.
- **Stateless** — the server holds no per-request state beyond the shared config. Safe to call from concurrent agents.

### CLI for Agent Pipelines

For agents that prefer subprocess over MCP, use the CLI with structured output:

```bash
# JSON output for parsing
cargo run --release -- --json --dry-run

# XML output
cargo run --release -- --xml --dry-run

# Night routine
cargo run --release -- --night --json --dry-run
```

The `RoutineResult` JSON schema includes: `routine_type`, `greeting`, `timestamp`, `year_progress`, `problems`, `running`, `history`, `quote`, and `formatted_message`.

## Running Stats

Place a file at `data/running.parquet` (or `.csv`) with two columns:

| Column | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `date` | `2026-05-27` |
| `distance_km` | `5.23` |

**On Android** — install [OpenTracks](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.dennisguse.opentracks/) (free, open-source) or any app that exports CSV, and drop the file in `data/`.

## GitHub Actions

Three workflows are included:

- **CI** — `cargo test --all-features` + `clippy` + `fmt` on every push
- **Daily Run** — fires at 01:17 UTC (4:17 AM Cairo), posts to GitHub Issue + Telegram + Discord, and commits the updated used-problems file back to the branch it ran on
- **Deep-ML Sync** — weekly sync of Deep-ML problems from GitHub (Sundays)

Set these repo secrets:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN        (auto-injected)
TELEGRAM_TOKEN
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
DISCORD_TOKEN
DISCORD_USER_ID
BIRTH_YEAR
TIMEZONE            (e.g. Africa/Cairo)

## Difficulty Scheduling

The system automatically schedules difficulty based on the day:

| Period | LeetCode | Deep-ML |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Weekdays** (Mon-Fri) | 1 problem/day, 3 Easy + 2 Medium across the week | 1 problem/day, 3 Easy + 2 Medium across the week |
| **Weekends** (Sat-Sun) | 2 problems/day, Medium + Hard | 2 problems/day, Medium + Hard |

Each platform independently rolls its difficulty. LeetCode could be Easy while Deep-ML is Medium on the same day.
